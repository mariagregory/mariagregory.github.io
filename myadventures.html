            <h2>Vacations in Cyprus</h2>
			<p><img class="intro" src="images/cyprus/cyprus_gov.jpg" alt="Vacations in Cyprus" />
				My hometown, Chelyabinsk, is located deeply inland, but since there are many lakes, finding a place for swimming in summer is not a problem. 
				But, of course, nothing can compare with sea water.</p>
				<p>Finally, I made it to the Mediterranean coast in June 2012 for 10-day vacations. It was unforgettable! The water is incredibly clean, 
				food is great, people are very hospitable and friendly. The island is small, its population is only about 700 thousands people, 
				but Cyprus is different in its different spots. The temperature in the Troodos mountains is always cooler than down, 
				the northern coast has stronger winds and wilder nature than the southern. Ancient ruins, villages, mountains, sea coasts - 
				wonderful nature and nice people beckon to visit Cyprus again and again. </p>

			<h2>Vacations in Belarus</h2>
			<p>I am half-belorussian, thanks to my mom. She was born in the city of Baranovichi in Brest region of Belorussian SSR, 
				finished technical school (kind of community college) in Minsk, and then graduated from the university in Moscow as an economost. 
				She came to Chelyabinsk city to work, met my father, and stayed. Soon, my brother and I were born.</p>
			<p>I remember, in the 80's the air tickets were cheap, and we often flew from Chelyabinsk to Minsk to visit my grandmother, and she could visit us.
				In the 90's the economy was in recession, and for about 10 years we could not afford to come to Belarus. </p>
			<p>Finally, in 2009, I arrived to Minsk, and for the first time I met my 15-year cousin! I was impressed by the cultural level of this small country.
				The streats are broad and very clean. The city is full of trees; actually, Minsk is one of the greenest cities in Europe. It was build anew 
				for less than 50 years after it was ruined completely in WWII. Many national parks, old castles, and churches were restaurated, and now 
				they host turists. I spent great time and will go again with pleasure. As for me, Belarus today is the best place for family life.</p>

			<p>Chelyabinsk oblast has a very diverse landscape formed over millions of years. There are various areas - from the lowlands 
			and hilly plains to mountain ranges. The region is also known as "land of lakes" since its territory has more than three thousand lakes.</p>
			<p>When I lived home, in Urals, I sometimes spent my weekends hiking with interesting people many of whom became my friends. 
			In hot summer days, there was nothing better than swimming in a lake. The nature of my homeland is incredible!</p>

					</div>
					<p>In the morning of February 15, 2013, in Chelyabinsk city, Russia, we had a guest from the space, the real meteorite! About 9 a.m., people were
				starting their work day, and I was also going to leave my apartment. While I was getting ready, I notice the strange bright light,
				which was not similar to neither car beams nor anything else I could think of. The light turned into bright red, orange, yellow,
				and ended up blinding white. I was hurrying, so I did not approach the window to see what it could be. In a few seconds, the deafening sound 
				burst out, as a thunder but much much louder. I heard some windows broke, the cars’ alarms screamed altogether, and everything shivered...
				Stunned, I looked outside and saw a few thick white lines on the sunny blue sky. Also I noticed small crack on my window glass.</p>
					<p>I went to a bus stop. Since I stepped out from my house, I saw people trying using their cell phones to call their relatives, but
				mobile connection hadn't been working for couple of hours. In the bus, some passengers supposed it was the new weapon experiment 
				(the Chebarkul military range is located 100 kilometers from Chelyabinsk), while others said it seemed like a meteorite. </p>
				
			<p>Since it happened just the next day after February 14, there is a joke:</p>
			<blockquote> Chelyabinsk romantics are so severe that when they promise their women<br/>to get the moon and the stars for the Valentine's Day, 
			they do it!</blockquote>
