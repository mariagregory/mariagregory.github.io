   <p>Non-professional website representing myself, in various capacities.</p>
  <p>Please do not judge this website by its appearance; it is made by hand for learning purposes and mostly <u><span style="color:blue;"><strong>for fun</strong></span></u>. For the same reason, there is no mobile version, so while it might look okay on PC, there are too many bugs if viewed on a cellphone. <i>Please be patient with me, I'm still learning the hard way.</i> Regardless of the visible amateurishness, all the information on the website is true. </p>
